## Break, Retest, and Liquidity Sweep Strategy

This script demonstrates what the Streamlit web interface would look like
when all dependencies are installed. The actual interface would be built
with Streamlit and would include:

1. Interactive price charts with pattern visualization
2. Real-time data from Bitget Exchange
3. AI-powered analysis using OpenAI
4. Strategy backtesting capabilities

To run the full application, these dependencies need to be installed:
- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- ccxt
- openai
- plotly

## AI Trading Assistant

The AI assistant would answer questions about trading strategies and patterns, such as:

Q: What is a break and retest pattern?
A: A break and retest pattern occurs when price breaks through a significant support or resistance level, then returns to test that level before continuing in the breakout direction. For a bullish break and retest, price breaks above resistance, pulls back to test the broken resistance (now support), and then continues upward. For a bearish break and retest, price breaks below support, pulls back to test the broken support (now resistance), and then continues downward. These patterns are valuable because they offer traders a higher-probability entry with a clearly defined risk level.

Q: How can I identify a good liquidity sweep setup?
A: A good liquidity sweep setup can be identified by these characteristics:
1. Price approaching a level with clustered stop losses (often below recent lows for longs or above recent highs for shorts)
2. Strong rejection after sweeping the level (quick reversal)
3. Higher than average volume during the sweep, showing strong participation
4. Price closing back beyond the swept level on the reversal candle
5. Previous market structure that suggests accumulation or distribution

The best setups occur at key technical levels where many traders would place stops, creating a pool of liquidity that larger players might target. Watch for price briefly breaking these levels before quickly reversing with strength, suggesting the sweep was engineered to collect liquidity before the actual move.
